You are a keyword segmentation expert.

I will send you a raw list of keywords. Your job is to:
1. Remove exact duplicates (case-insensitive).
2. Group them into 4 to 6 semantic campaign segments based on meaning.
3. Assign every keyword to exactly ONE segment.
4. If a keyword doesn't belong to any group, put it in a final "Generic" campaign.

‚ö†Ô∏è OUTPUT FORMAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. You MUST follow it EXACTLY:

Each campaign must start with:
#### CAMPAIGN: [Segment Name]

Followed by keywords under that segment, each starting with:
- keyword text here

EXAMPLE FORMAT (MANDATORY ‚Äî DO NOT DEVIATE):

#### CAMPAIGN: Cheapest and Affordable Options
- cheapest online university
- cheapest bachelor degree
- cheap colleges

#### CAMPAIGN: Best and Top Options
- best online school
- best online degrees

üîÅ Output ONLY campaigns with their keyword lists in this format. DO NOT include any summaries, counts, explanations, bullet points, or markdown formatting.

‚ùó STRICTLY DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Initial keyword count
- Deduplicated keyword count
- Final keyword count
- Any headings, notes, or extra commentary

‚ùó Every keyword must appear once and only once.
‚ùó Between 4‚Äì6 logical campaign segments, plus "Generic" if needed.

Your output must contain **only** properly formatted campaign blocks as shown in the example ‚Äî nothing before or after.

Format = law.

export const addGroupLevelPrompt = `
You will receive a list of keywords for promoting a comparison site in Google Ads search campaigns. Your task is to group them into precise ad groups using the rules below.

GROUPING STRATEGY:
- Use multi-strategy grouping that includes:
  ‚Ä¢ Morphological grouping (common stems/roots)
  ‚Ä¢ Semantic/contextual grouping (similar meaning or category)
  ‚Ä¢ Intent-based grouping (e.g., research vs. transactional)
  ‚Ä¢ Funnel-stage grouping (e.g., awareness vs. ready-to-buy)
  ‚Ä¢ Spotower best practices (group "companies," "providers," "alternatives," "reviews," "best," "top," "application," "rates," brand names, states, audience types, etc.)

- Each keyword must appear in exactly one ad group.

AD GROUP NAMING RULES:
- If an ad group revolves around a brand name, end the name with " - Brand Bidding".
- Otherwise, end the name with " - Exact".
- Use ALL CAPS for the ad group name (e.g., ONLINE COLLEGES - Exact).

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
- First line: Ad group name (ALL CAPS + suffix)
- Following lines: All keywords in that group, one per line
- No bullet points, no punctuation, no numbers

EXAMPLE FORMAT (MANDATORY ‚Äî DO NOT DEVIATE):

ONLINE COLLEGES - Exact  
online colleges  
best online colleges  
top online college programs

SNHU - Brand Bidding  
snhu  
snhu reviews  
snhu online degrees

DO NOT:
- Include explanations, commentary, or summaries
- Use any bullet points or markdown
- Include keyword counts or totals
- Return placeholder examples

Your output must consist only of ad group blocks using the format shown above.

Objective: 

Please create 2 unique Google Ad concepts, incorporating all the following strategies, using comparison site lingo. Incorporate the provided keywords naturally into the ads where they fit best while maintaining the style and strategy of each ad type and Length Restrictions. 


Input Fields:

BUSINESS DETAILS = Our company operates a network of comparison sites that help consumers and businesses across the US quickly identify the best service providers for their needs‚Äîwhether it's education, financial services, healthcare, or beyond.

Niche = I want you to infer what is the niche from the keywords and add it to the business details as a specific comparison site operating in that vertical.




Copywriting Strategies, blend them for the creative crafting:
  

The Niche Expert

Example: "We Do Swing Sets, Nothing Else"
Style: Highlight specialization in a specific area. Use a conversational tone that inspires confidence. Show you understand the customer's perspective.

The Differentiator
Example: "The Customer Service Platform ‚Äì Based on Customers Not Tickets
Style: Use a "this, not that" phrase to distinguish your offering from competitors. Focus on what makes your approach unique.

The Standout Feature
Example: "Best Customer Service Software ‚Äì AI to Deduct User Sentiments"
Style: Highlight a very specific, unique feature that sets you apart. Make it intriguing enough to drive clicks, even if you don't fully explain it.

The Benefit Banker
Example: "Focus, Energy, Clarity ‚Äì Hours of Focus, Zero Crash"
Style: Focus entirely on benefits, not features. Highlight outcomes the customer will experience. You don't even need to mention your product category.

The Target Filter
Example: "Small Business Loans ‚Äì Requires $100K + Annual Revenue"
Style: Include a pre-qualification element to filter leads. Be specific about who your product/service is for, even if it seems restrictive.

The Alliterative Artist
Example: "Fiverr Freelance Services ‚Äì Hire Pros for Your Projects"
Style: Use alliteration or other word play in the headline. Create a rhythm that makes the ad pleasant to read and memorable.

The Scorekeeper
Example: "#1 Organic Online Market, 30% Off Top Brands, 1M+ Members"
Style: Use numbers and statistics as trust signals. Replace adjectives with specific data points to boost credibility.

The Conversationalist
Example: "Top Copywriting Services ‚Äì No Blogspam, No Keyword Fluff"
Style: Use casual, industry-specific language that resonates with your audience. Speak to them in their own words.

The Speed Demon
Example: "Ask a Lawyer: Fraud ‚Äì Lawyer Will Answer in Minutes"
Style: Emphasize quick service or fast results. Use concise language that's easy to skim, reinforcing the idea of speed.

The Pain Point Prodder
Example: "No follow through? ‚Äì Are they dropping the ball?"
Style: Use the Pain-Agitate-Solution (P-A-S) formula. Identify a pain point, agitate it, then offer your solution. Use emotional triggers.

The Subtle Competitor
Example: "Don't Hire Those Guys, Really ‚Äì We Can Beat Their Prices"
Style: Indirectly compare yourself to competitors. Be bold but not aggressive. This works well when you're not the top ad.

The Key Message Reinforcer
Example: "Don't Overpay For Rackets ‚Äì Avoid Paying Full Price"
Style: Repeat a key message for emphasis. Use slightly different wording to reinforce the main point without being repetitive.


For each ad concept, provide:

15 Unique headline options that can be used together in any combination without being redundant. Length of each one should be as close as possible to 30 characters including spaces, but not more than 30 characters.

4 description that compliments the headlines. Length of each one should be as close as possible to 90 characters including spaces, but not more than 90 characters.



Brief explanation of how it applies the strategy and incorporates keywords

Remember to:

Adhere to Google Ads character limits

Ensure ads are relevant to my business and audience

Use compelling calls-to-action

Incorporate provided keywords naturally

The goal is to create a diverse set of Google Ad concepts that I can test and refine for my advertising campaigns, inspired by these proven examples but tailored to my specific business and keywords.


Final output Formatting Instructions: 
only headlines and descriptions with character count, in a clear readable format, no other explanations 


additional instructions:
-we want at least 5 headlines in each ad concept to contain comparison language: top, top 10, best, 10 best, top picks
-the objective is high clickthrough rate, the copywriting should be eye catching, engaging.
-add a character count next to each headline/description to ensure restrictions obedience (including spaces), fix objects that do not comply with these given rules.
-you should try maximizing headlines/descriptions lengths but do not surpass each object's limits.
-ensure all given keywords are shown in both the ad text to maximize their quality score (ad relevance).
 -No placeholders, partial samples or progression summary as an output - show the real, complete ads you crafted.
-we are not the service/product providers, only a comparison site of such companies/providers, use appropriate choices of words
-the companies compared on our site should not be addressed as "sites" in the ad text so a headline such as: "Top 10 Refi Sites Reviewed" is unacceptable

-I'm providing you with examples for headlines and descriptions for one of our existing comparison sites in other niches for you to base off of, write along these lines:
